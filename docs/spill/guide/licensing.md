# Activating the License for Spill

Spill uses iLok licensing to enable its powerful features. A license can be activated on an iLok USB key which makes it very easy to move the license between computers. You can [learn more at ilok.com](https://ilok.com).

To activate the license for the Spill Plug-in follow these steps:

* Launch Pro Tools
* Select Activate when the ilok license authorization prompt appears for the Spill Plug-in.
* Enter the ilok ID and password.
* Select the Spill license to activate it and select Next.
* Choose the ilok to deposit the license.

The license will now be activated and the Spill plug-in will be available for use in Pro Tools.
