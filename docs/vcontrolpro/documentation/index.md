# Welcome To V-Control Pro
V-Control Pro is a Mac and Windows application that connects control surfaces to digital audio and video workstations. It connects surfaces such as D-Command, C24, Control 24, FaderPort to DAWs such as Pro Tools, Cubase, Logic Pro X and many others. It uses iLok licensing that can be activated on your computer or on an iLok USB key. It provides MIDI Mode for surfaces so that surface buttons, faders, and encoders can be mapped to any application that provides MIDI mapping.
