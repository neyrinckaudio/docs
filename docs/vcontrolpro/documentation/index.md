# Welcome To V-Control Pro
V-Control Pro is a Mac OS / Windows application that connects control surfaces to digital audio and video workstation applications. 

## Legacy Ethernet and MIDI Surfaces
Digidesign and Avid manufactured several control surfaces that only connected to older versions of Pro Tools HD / Ultimate. V-Control Pro connects these surfaces to all modern versions of Pro Tools Studio and Pro Tools Ultimate. And V-Control Pro connects these surfaces to all popular audio, video, and MIDI applications such as Logic Pro, Cubase, Nuendo, Studio One, and many more.
