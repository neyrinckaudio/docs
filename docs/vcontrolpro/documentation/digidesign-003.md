# Digidesign 003

V-Control Pro supports the Digidesign 003 firewire surface. A compatible 003 driver must be installed on the computer.

!!! warning "V-Control Pro Does Not Provide Firewire Drivers"
    You must install a 003 firewire driver that allows the Mac or Windows computer to provide audio I/O and MIDI I/O. Last time we looked, Avid's drivers do not work well with modern computers, especially Mac systems.
