# Setting Up Mackie Control DAWs

Many DAWs and media applications use the Mackie Control protocol to support control surfaces. V-Control Pro translates the Mackie Control protocol to several control surfaces that previously only worked with Pro Tools. These DAWs and media applications do not automatically detect surfaces and must be manually configured to use V-Control Pro's virtual MIDI ports. Configure the DAW/Media application to use one Mackie Control device,for the first 8 channels of control, with the V-Control MIDI port. Configure additional Mackie Control XT devices, with the V-Control XT2, XT3, and XT4 MIDI ports, for control surfaces that have 16, 24, or 32 channels.
