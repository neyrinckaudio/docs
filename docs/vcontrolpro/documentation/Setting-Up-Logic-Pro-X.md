# Setting Up Logic Pro X

Logic Pro will not be detected until it has connected to a control surface supported by V-Control Pro with Logic Pro. Follow these steps to connect it to a control surface.

* Open the V-Control Pro Setups window and make sure your surface has been added to the Controllers... section and it is actively detected.
* Launch Logic Pro
* Ensure "Automatic Installation" is enabled in the Control Surface setup in Logic.
* Logic automatically detects any controller setup through V-Control Pro. Click Connect when the automatic setup window pops up.
* Select "Add" when the window pops up saying it has detected Control Surface.
* V-Control Pro and Logic Pro should now have bidirectional communication.
* In some cases, Logic Pro will provide one-way communication. If that happens, follow these steps:
    * Quit Logic Pro.
    * Open the V-Control Pro Preferencess window. Toggle the "Logic Pro - Use IPv6" setting.
    * Launch Logic Pro.
