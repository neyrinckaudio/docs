Press the \u201cselect\u201d button in the upper right hand corner off Window, to choose among all available computer windows to display and control. The choices are organized first by computer application, and then from within the various windows within each application. Select the specific window you wish to control, which in many cases would be the floating window of an effect or instrument plug-in. The V-window interface will display a copy of the specifically selected computer window. Touch the controls in the window, which will have the same effect as adjusting those controls with a mouse. V-Window Operational Notes</p> <p>In some cases, V-Window will see a new plug-in window automatically. However, it will occasionally go dark. If this occurs, simply tap the select button and re-select the specific window you wish to control. V-Window is designed to be as responsive as possible to a mouse drag operation. This means that it does not respond to iPad-specific gestures such as pinch, drag, and double tap. To adjust the area of the virtual window that can be seen and controlled, touch the \u201cAdjust\u201d button, which allows you to: Drag the window in V-Control to see the desired content. Pinch to enlarge or reduce the size of the window display. When this action has been completed, touch the \u201cDone\u201d button. Note that, when using V-Window, not only is the selected window displayed, but also all windows \"above\" it, allowing windows such as popup messages to be seen can be seen. This means that sometimes you may select a window, but will actually see a different window above. If this occurs, simply tap on a section of the desired window to bring it forward in the V-Window. V-Window can be viewed in full screen mode, letting you work with as much screen real estate as possible. This is done by tapping the diagonal arrows in the menu bar of V-Window. NOTE: For optimal performance, V-Window should be used on only one device at a time.</p> <p>NOTE: In the web app version of V-Console, the zoom function is not available.</p>"},{"location":"vcontrolpro/documentation/","title":"Welcome To V-Control Pro","text":"<p>V-Control Pro is a Mac OS / Windows application that connects control surfaces to digital audio and video workstation applications.</p> <p>Release Notes Installers Compatibility Chart</p>"},{"location":"vcontrolpro/documentation/#legacy-digidesignavid-surfaces","title":"Legacy Digidesign/Avid Surfaces","text":"<p>Digidesign and Avid manufactured superb control surfaces that connected to Pro Tools HD / Ultimate.

Mute While in V-Window mode, the Mute button on the last channel strip will cycle through the various V-Window Modes which are listed below: VButton: Use this mode to interact with button controls. The mouse will stay in its place and activate a button press when the fader is touched. VButtonSet: Use this mode to create and cycle through different button set points. With the mouse hovering above the on screen button's position press Shift+Solo on the control surface to set a Pin at that location. Using the fader in this mode will cylce between multiple Pins to use with VButton mode. VWKnob: Use this mode when interacting with knob controls on the plug-ins GUI.
